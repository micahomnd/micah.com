summary: "Why I write."

One of my inspirations, Aaron Swartz, excerpted the following by sociologist C. Wright Mills in his explanation of why he set up a weblog:

> As a social scientist, you have to … capture what you experience and sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman. But how can you do this? One answer is: you must set up a file…
In such a file … there is joined personal experience and professional activities, studies under way and studies planned. In this file, you … will try to get together what you are doing intellectually and what you are experiencing as a person. here you will not be afraid to use your experience and relate it directly to various work in progress. By serving as a check on repetitious work, your blog also enables you to conserve your energy. It also encourages you to capture ‘fringe-thoughts’: various ideas which may be byproducts of everyday life, snatches of conversation overheard in the street, or, for that matter, dreams. Once noted, these may lead to more systematic thinking, as well as lend intellectual relevance to more directed experience.
…The file also helps you build up the habit of writing. … In developing the file, you can experiment as a writer and this, as they say, develop your powers of expression.

Replace file with weblog, and you have a good explanation of why I write. It helps me process my experience, distill what I've learned, and remodel my view of the world accordingly. It serves as 
both a way to improve my thoughts and to document myself through the journey of life as I continue to learn and grow.
And, as Aaron said, though fundamentally this weblog is a personal artifact, for myself, I hope it is of interest to others as well.
